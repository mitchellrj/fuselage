0.0.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Execute resources are now implicitly named by taking the command or commands
  parameters and filterning non-ascii non-alphanumeric characters out. For
  example, an Execute that did ``touch /foo`` would be implicitly named
  ``touch-foo``.

- Extend changes.ShellCommand so that it can be instructed to log something
  other than command.

- Clean up temporary files after execution.

- Add a ResourceBundle.from_iterator(..) convenience method. When used with
  generators it will throw validation errors at the point where the resource
  was yielded.

- Add support for --simulate flag passing in fabric backend.

- Add support for Yum packages.


0.0.1 (2014-07-06)
