Fuselage
========

The ``fuselage`` module provides a Python API for declaring and applying
configuration to a compute resource such as a Linux server.

Fuselage is not an imperative system for server management. Instead it is a framework for building configuration bundles that can be applied to any system with a python interpreter.

It does not mandate a transport/execution mechanism. A compiled bundle could be transferred to the target system by ssh, https or even flash drive.
