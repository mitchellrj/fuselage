Debian Preseeding with Fuselage
===============================

The Debian preseed system allows you to preanswer debconf questions with
values. This allows Debian Installer to finish setting up a machine without and
user interaction. However this will leave you with a fairly empty Debian
system. If you want to preconfigure an application ready for deployment you'll
need to run your own scripts in the FIXME post_script hook.
